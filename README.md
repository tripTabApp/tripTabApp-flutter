# Introduction
Our program is designed to manage the budget allocated by your company for its employees and calculate the increase or decrease in the budget for travel related to courses and conferences.

The program aims to improve financial planning and track expenses associated with travel and attendance.

Initially, you will enter the company's available budget for each employee or the team as a whole. You can specify the total budget for a specific period, such as a month, quarter, or year.

Then, when an employee wishes to attend a training course or conference, they will enter the event details and expected costs into the program. These costs will be reviewed against the available budget for the employee or team.

Based on this information, the program will calculate the increase or decrease in the available travel budget. If the expected costs for the event exceed the budget, the program will indicate the deficit. Conversely, if the costs are lower than the budget, the program will show a surplus.

This way, the program helps you monitor and manage the budget for travel and attendance at courses and conferences, ensuring efficient allocation of resources within the company.
